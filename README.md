# Scoder Challenge

ðŸ”— [Access the live project](https://scoder-silk.vercel.app/)

Please read the entire README file to understand the decisions made and the step-by-step instructions on how to run the project.

## AI Usage
- Used to fix English grammar and spelling.
- Used to fix small bugs.
- Used to create or refactor small parts of the code.

## Configure Environment
First of all, you need to configure some environment variables to run Docker and make the project work.  
Create a `.env` file by copying the variable names from `.env.example`. Then, set your own values.  

**Important:** The database host should be `postgres_db` because the name of the Docker container is `postgres_db`.  
**Important:** `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, and `POSTGRES_DB` must match the placeholders in the following URL:  
`postgresql://POSTGRES_USER:POSTGRES_PASSWORD@postgres_db:5432/POSTGRES_DB`

## How to Run Docker
- Install Docker: Follow the official [Docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/) to install it.
- Run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
- To stop and remove the containers, run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose down -v
    ```

## Decisions

- Why use Shadcn:  
  - _Because it allows faster development of good UI without wasting too much time._

- Why deploy on Vercel:  
  - _For two main reasons: first, simplicity and speed; second, cost. Honestly, I would appreciate it much more if I could deploy on a VPS, configure it myself, and use my own domain._
